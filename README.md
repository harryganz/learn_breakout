# Implementation of a simple breakout game
The instructions for making this game can be found at:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Workflows/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

Although the tutorial comes with very good instructions, it doesn't have a
repository, so I made one myself. I made the result of each article in the
tutorial a different branch names step-1, step-2, etc. However, there are some slight differences in the order of the code, so beware.
